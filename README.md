### Context:

This is my last project of Mod1 and it's a solo project. The architect of the application followed the suggested architect. The business logics of the game live in Player.js and Game.js and the user view and interation live in HTML CSS and Main.js. In order to test the data model, I created unit test for the game.js and player.js and used browser dev tool for html and main.js for any debugging. The project breakdown is in gitHub projects section.

### Learning Goals:

Solidify and demonstration of DRY JavaScript
Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges:

Wins: Completed a working MVP with no bug!. 

Challenges: Planning the game view and user intereaction were challenging. I ended up writing additional condition to fix bug instead of writing the functions with more thoughful consideration.
